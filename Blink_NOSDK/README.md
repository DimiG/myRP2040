Blink_NOSDK
===========
This project demonstrates how you can use assembly language without using a proprietary [SDK][picosdk]. The manufacturer **DOES NOT RECOMMEND** abandoning the **SDK** as it is a way to introduce errors into the project. This example is intended for teaching purposes. In real projects, the use of proprietary tools is recommended.

Program description
